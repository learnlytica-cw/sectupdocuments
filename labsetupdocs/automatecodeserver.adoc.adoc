= Automating Multi-User Code-server Setup with GitHub Actions


This guide provides instructions for automating the deployment of a multi-user `code-server` environment on AWS using GitHub Actions. Each user will have an isolated `code-server` instance, accessible via a domain and configured for iframe embedding with Nginx.

== Prerequisites

- AWS credentials with permissions to create and configure EC2 instances.
- SSH key pair for connecting to EC2 (stored as a GitHub Secret).
- Domain name set up for SSL and access configuration.
- Basic knowledge of GitHub Actions and Ansible (for automated configuration).

== Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

1. **Create a `.github/workflows` Directory**:
   - Inside your repository, add a directory named `.github/workflows` to hold GitHub Actions workflow files.

2. **Store Secrets in GitHub**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and Variables** > **Actions** in your GitHub repository.
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key.
     - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key.
     - `EC2_KEY_PAIR`: SSH private key for connecting to the instance.
     - `DOMAIN_NAME`: Your domain name (e.g., `your-domain.com`).
     - `USER_PASSWORD`: The base password for users.
     - `EC2_INSTANCE_ID`: (Optional) if using an existing instance.

== Step 2: Define GitHub Actions Workflow

In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a workflow file named `setup-code-server.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Setup Multi-User Code-server Environment

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      instance_type:
        description: 'AWS EC2 Instance Type'

          EOF


== Explanation of Key Steps

EC2 Setup:
The workflow launches an EC2 instance (or uses an existing one if EC2_INSTANCE_ID is set) and installs code-server along with required packages.
User Creation and Code-server Configuration:
The workflow iterates over 20 users (user1 to user20), creating each user with a systemd service for code-server on a unique port.
Nginx Configuration with SSL and iframe:
Nginx is configured as a reverse proxy for each user, with SSL enabled using Let’s Encrypt. The X-Frame-Options header is modified to allow iframe embedding.


= Running the Multi-User Code-server Automation Workflow with GitHub Actions

This guide explains how to set up, configure, and execute the GitHub Actions workflow to automate a multi-user `code-server` environment on AWS with Nginx, SSL, and iframe embedding.

== Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Repository

1. **Create a New Repository** (or use an existing one) on GitHub where this workflow will reside.
2. **Add the Workflow File**:
   - In your repository, create the following file path and add the workflow file:
     ```
     .github/workflows/setup-code-server.yml
     ```
   - Copy and paste the workflow content provided in the `setup-code-server.yml` file and save it.

== Step 2: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. **Navigate to Repository Secrets**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and Variables** > **Actions** in your GitHub repository.
   
2. **Add the Required Secrets**:
   - **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: Your AWS access key ID with permissions to manage EC2.
   - **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: Your AWS secret access key.
   - **EC2_KEY_PAIR**: Paste the full contents of your `.pem` file (SSH private key) here to allow SSH connections.
   - **DOMAIN_NAME**: The domain name pointing to your EC2 instance (e.g., `your-domain.com`).
   - **USER_PASSWORD**: A base password that will be set for all user accounts on `code-server`.
   - **Optional**: `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` if you want to use an existing instance instead of creating a new one.

== Step 3: Run the Workflow

1. **Trigger the Workflow**:
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
   - Select the **Setup Multi-User Code-server Environment** workflow from the left sidebar.
   - Click **Run workflow** to manually trigger it. You can specify an EC2 instance type or use the default (`t3.medium`).

2. **Monitor the Workflow**:
   - Monitor each step as it runs in real-time. Key steps include:
     - Provisioning the EC2 instance or using an existing instance.
     - Configuring each user’s `code-server` instance on a unique port.
     - Setting up Nginx to manage reverse proxy, SSL, and iframe embedding.

3. **Workflow Steps Overview**:
   - **Set up EC2 Instance**: Launches or connects to an EC2 instance.
   - **Configure Code-server for Multiple Users**: Creates 20 user accounts, each with a dedicated `code-server` instance.
   - **Configure Nginx with SSL and iframe Embedding**: Configures Nginx for each user with SSL from Let’s Encrypt.

== Step 4: Verify the Setup

Once the workflow completes successfully, your setup will be accessible at the domain specified in the `DOMAIN_NAME` secret.

1. **Access Each User's Code-server Instance**:
   - Each user should be accessible via URLs like:
     ```
     https://your-domain.com/user1/?password=USER_PASSWORD
     https://your-domain.com/user2/?password=USER_PASSWORD
     ```
   
2. **Test SSL and iframe Embedding**:
   - Open the URLs in an iframe to confirm that `X-Frame-Options` are set correctly and the site is accessible with SSL.

== Troubleshooting Tips

- **EC2 Instance Errors**: If the EC2 setup fails, check the IAM permissions for your AWS credentials to ensure they allow EC2 creation and management.
- **SSL Issues**: If Let’s Encrypt SSL setup fails, ensure your domain’s DNS records point to the EC2 instance IP and that DNS propagation is complete.
- **Nginx Configuration**: If users aren’t accessible, verify the Nginx configuration by connecting to the EC2 instance and running `sudo nginx -t` and `sudo systemctl status nginx`.

== Summary

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the setup of a multi-user `code-server` environment, providing each user with isolated instances accessible via SSL and embeddable in iframes. This setup ensures secure and scalable access for multiple users on a single EC2 instance.

= Domain Configuration Guide for Multi-User Code-server Setup

This guide explains how to configure your domain in GoDaddy (or another provider) to point to an AWS EC2 instance for the `code-server` environment. It covers DNS record setup, SSL certificate prerequisites, and testing.

== Step 1: Log in to Your Domain Provider Account

1. **Log in to GoDaddy** (or your domain provider).
   - Navigate to [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com) and sign in to your account.

2. **Access DNS Settings**:
   - Locate the domain you want to use for your `code-server` setup.
   - Open the **DNS Management** or **DNS Settings** panel for this domain.

== Step 2: Configure DNS Records

To map your domain to the public IP address of your AWS EC2 instance, configure the following DNS records:

1. **Add an A Record**:
   - An A record maps your domain (e.g., `your-domain.com`) to the IP address of your EC2 instance.

   - **Host**: `@` (or leave blank to represent the root domain, e.g., `your-domain.com`).
   - **Points to**: The public IP address of your EC2 instance. This IP can be found in your AWS EC2 Console under the **Public IPv4 address** section.
   - **TTL**: Set to the default (typically 1 hour).

2. **Add a CNAME Record (Optional)**:
   - A CNAME record can map `www.your-domain.com` to your root domain (`your-domain.com`). This allows access to your `code-server` setup with or without the `www` prefix.

   - **Host**: `www`
   - **Points to**: `your-domain.com`
   - **TTL**: Set to the default.

3. **Save Changes**:
   - Save your DNS settings after adding or updating records. DNS changes typically take a few minutes to a few hours to propagate, depending on the **TTL** setting.

== Step 3: Verify DNS Configuration

1. **Test Domain Propagation**:
   - To check if the domain points to your EC2 instance, use a DNS propagation tool such as [DNSChecker.org](https://dnschecker.org).
   - Enter your domain (`your-domain.com`) and verify that the A record points to your EC2 IP address globally.

2. **Check Domain Resolution Locally**:
   - You can also verify by running the following command in your terminal:

     ```bash
     nslookup your-domain.com
     ```

   - This command should return the IP address of your EC2 instance.

== Step 4: Set Up SSL Using Let’s Encrypt (GitHub Actions Workflow)

Once the domain is mapped to your EC2 instance, SSL certificates can be automatically set up with Let’s Encrypt using the GitHub Actions workflow provided.

1. **Prerequisite for SSL**:
   - Ensure that your domain fully resolves to your EC2 instance IP (verify with Step 3).
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will use Certbot to request and configure SSL certificates automatically.

2. **Run the GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Trigger the **Setup Multi-User Code-server Environment** workflow in your GitHub repository.
   - This workflow will:
     - Verify that the domain points to your EC2 IP.
     - Use Certbot to generate SSL certificates with Let’s Encrypt for `your-domain.com`.
     - Configure Nginx with SSL settings and reverse proxy for each `code-server` user instance.

== Step 5: Test the SSL Setup

After the workflow completes, verify that your domain is accessible via HTTPS:

1. **Open Your Domain in a Browser**:
   - Visit `https://your-domain.com` in a browser to confirm that SSL is active.

2. **Access Each User’s `code-server` Instance**:
   - Each user instance should be accessible via URLs like:
     ```
     https://your-domain.com/user1/?password=USER_PASSWORD
     https://your-domain.com/user2/?password=USER_PASSWORD
     ```
   - The `X-Frame-Options` header in Nginx is configured to allow iframe embedding, so you can embed these URLs in iframes if needed.

== Troubleshooting Domain and SSL Issues

- **DNS Not Resolving**: If your domain is not pointing to the EC2 IP, double-check your A record and ensure that DNS propagation is complete.
- **SSL Certificate Issues**: If the SSL certificate fails to generate, confirm that the domain resolves correctly. You can rerun the GitHub Actions workflow to re-attempt SSL configuration.

== Summary

You’ve configured your GoDaddy (or similar) domain to point to your AWS EC2 instance and enabled SSL. Your multi-user `code-server` environment is now accessible at `your-domain.com` with secure HTTPS access.
